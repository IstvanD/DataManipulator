/**
 * The model implementation for the DataManipulator service. Represents a row in the &quot;DM_DataManipulator&quot; database table, with each column mapped to a property of this class.
 *
 * <p>
 * Helper methods and all application logic should be put in this class. Whenever methods are added, rerun ServiceBuilder to copy their definitions into the {@link com.liferay.tool.datamanipulator.model.DataManipulator} interface.

 *
 * <p>
 * Never reference this class directly. All methods that expect a data manipulator model instance should use the {@link DataManipulator} interface instead.
